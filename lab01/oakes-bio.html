            I am Alexander Oakes; I am a Policy Studies Major in the Maxwell School. I am unsure what specific area of public policy I want to peruse but I live on a reservation so possible Native American Policy would be applicable to me. I am a very outgoing person and enjoy and thrive in a group work environment, as well as being a very creative thinker and a driven person. I play on the Syracuse Club hockey team and enjoy Skiing and Snowboarding as well as golf, volleyball, and wakeboarding, basically any physical activity. However, I am also very interested in technology and how it impacts society.
